# Corporate Food Checker

These are simply applications for concentrating requests for ready-made meals in an office or company.

The user can choose a lunch previously created by the administrator for a specific date and confirm his choice until 10 am. After that, a report is generated for the administrator on the number of meals selected by users for each date.

Instructions for using the application are located in the Docimentation/UserGuides directory.
